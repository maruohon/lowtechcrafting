Low Tech Crafting
==============
Low Tech Crafting is a mod for Minecraft that adds just one new block: a 'Better Crafting Table'.
It's almost like the vanilla Crafting Table, except that it has a persistent inventory,
which can also be interacted with by 'automation', for example by Hoppers.

The mod was started by Xcom6000, and the idea was to demonstrate to Mojang how the vanilla
Crafting Table could be enhanced, so that it would also work for automated crafting contraptions.
